      question: "Which treatment is best for me?",
      answer:
        "We start with a complimentary consultation and skin/medical assessment to understand your goals and suitability. Your practitioner will recommend a personalised plan that may include Laser Hair Removal, Facial Therapy, Dermal Filler, Anti-Wrinkle injections, Fat Dissolving, or a tailored Skin Care routine. Patch tests are carried out where required (e.g., laser) before any course begins.",
      isExpanded: true,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How does Laser Hair Removal work and how many sessions will I need?",
      answer:
        "Our medical-grade laser targets the pigment in the hair follicle to reduce regrowth. Most clients need 6â€“8 sessions spaced 4â€“6 weeks apart, with occasional maintenance. A patch test is required at least 24â€“48 hours before your first session. You should shave the area 24 hours prior, avoid sunbeds/self-tan, and use SPF on exposed areas throughout your course.",
      isExpanded: false,
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "Is Fat Dissolving safe and what results can I expect?",
      answer:
        "Fat Dissolving injections (for small, stubborn pockets like chin or lower abdomen) break down fat cells which are then naturally eliminated by the body. Typical plans are 2â€“4 sessions, 4â€“6 weeks apart. You may experience swelling, tenderness, or bruising for 3â€“7 days. Results build gradually; a balanced lifestyle helps maintain them. Not suitable during pregnancy/breastfeeding or for certain medical conditions.",
      isExpanded: false,
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "I have sensitive or acne-prone skinâ€”can I book Facial Therapy?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Our Facial Therapy is fully bespoke. We select gentle, clinically backed actives and adjust intensity based on your skin type and tolerance. Treatments can target congestion, dehydration, dullness, or pigmentation. Mild redness can occur and usually settles within hours. Youâ€™ll receive a home-care plan to maintain results between visits.",
      isExpanded: false,
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "How long do Dermal Fillers last and are they reversible?",
      answer:
        "We use premium hyaluronic-acid fillers to softly enhance features and restore volume. Longevity is typically 6â€“12 months depending on the area, product, and lifestyle. You may see mild swelling or bruising for a few days. HA fillers can be dissolved with hyaluronidase if clinically indicated. A full medical consultation is completed prior to treatment.",
      isExpanded: false,
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "When will I see results from Anti-Wrinkle injections and how long do they last?",
      answer:
        "Initial smoothing is usually noticed in 3â€“5 days, with peak results around 2 weeks. Effects commonly last 3â€“4 months, varying by dose, muscle strength, and lifestyle. We offer a two-week review (where appropriate) to ensure a natural, balanced finish.",
      isExpanded: false,
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "What aftercare should I follow and is there any downtime?",
      answer:
        "Most treatments have little to no downtime. General guidance: avoid heat, steam rooms, and strenuous exercise for 24 hours; keep the area clean; use SPF 30+ daily; avoid alcohol the day of injectable treatments; and donâ€™t massage treated areas unless advised. Your practitioner will give you tailored aftercare and red-flag advice to contact us if needed.",

      question: "How do bookings, pricing, and cancellations work?",
      answer:
        "Treatment prices vary by area and plan; full costs are confirmed during consultation. A deposit may be required to secure your appointment and is redeemable against treatment. We kindly ask for at least 48 hoursâ€™ notice to reschedule; late cancellations or no-shows may forfeit the deposit. We accept major cards. Please arrive a few minutes early for forms and patch tests where applicable.",
